# Learn yo scales

A lo-fi single page application with no dependencies, purely to address the very specific
niche of musical theory I'm currently at odds with. Thought making this may be quicker than
trawling through the app store, and I was right.

### TODO
 - Add modes.
 - Make "help" easier to digest.
 - Investigate the absolute easiest way to get this into an offline mobile app.
 - Add more game modes as the whim dictates.
 - Learning Mode... Add more intervals & notes after *n* successive answers.
